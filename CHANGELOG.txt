- DominateLabeledImage updated:
  Support for unequal image sizes, same detection check error.
  - The deleteSimilarDetections function should now work on image datasets of different sizes.
  - Fixed the error of checking the same tag in detection similarity check.
  - opencv 'check file path/integrity' warning is now not printing anymore.
  - Now, if the deleteSimilarDetections method is interrupted, it should delete the alone datas.

## 0.1.2 Beta 07.05.2024
- DominateLabeledImage:
  - Images are now stored in memory instead of operations such as reading, writing and deleting files. However, the speed of the method needs to be increased.
